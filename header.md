# nlp-corpora

UW NLP maintains a repository of corpora for internal UW use on the UW CSE
department fileserver at `/projects/nlp-corpora/`.

The main purpose of this document is to provide a live, browsable index of all
of the corpora. Below that are instructions for accessing the corpora and
proposing new additions.

## Live Status
