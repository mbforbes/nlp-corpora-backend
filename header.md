**_A community-built high-quality repository of NLP corpora_**

This project aims to collect a shared repository of corpora useful for NLP
researchers, available inside UW.

- **Community-built** — New corpora are encouraged! Official benchmark tasks,
  large-scale recipe scrapes, collections of old novels—all are welcome.

- **High-quality** — Each corpus undergoes a vetting process to ensure it is of
  a marked version and has known state, consistent structure, and ample
  documentation. Once it is added, a corpus becomes read-only to guard against
  accidental modifications. A daily crawler indexes the full collection and
  performs several checks on every file of every corpus (browsable
  [below](#live-status)).

- **UW accessible** — All corpora live on the UW CSE department fileserver at
  `/projects/nlp-corpora/` where they enjoy automatic backups. Friends in EE,
  Linguistics, or other departments can [easily receive free
  access](#access-outside-uw-cse).

See below for a live, browsable index of all of the corpora, as well
as instructions for accessing the corpora and proposing new additions.

## Live Status

This table contains a live view of all corpora. It is updated daily by a
crawler that scans all corpora and checks that they meet quality guidelines
(immutability, access permissions, documentation, and corpus structure).

Click on any corpus to view its readme.

If the **Access** column shows a ✓, then it is open-access and ready for use.
If not, the corpus is under restricted access due to its license or terms of
use. Visit the [Restricted access](#restricted-access) section for details on
each of these corpora.
